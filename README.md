# NUS Climbing Club Attendance Tracker

Interaction only via Telegram bot - to be created -

## Description 

This application will help to semi-automatically track member's attendances.

Members are required to scan the QR codes at USC / UTown and key in their NUSNET ID minimally (as that is the key value we are using to update their attendance).

The weekly attendance sheet will then be updated to the master attendance sheet on a weekly basis.
